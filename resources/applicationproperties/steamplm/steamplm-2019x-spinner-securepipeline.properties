#Following properties are specific to Enviroment. Its required to run builds on specific envioronment.
# Always start property name with environment as its configured in trigger job and append it with _ (Ex: DEV1_)
# <env>_artifactory_appconfig_file is the appconfig.json file location path in artifactory (Mandatory)
# <env>_artifactory_artifact_file path is used as target to copy artifacts into artifactory (Mandatory)
# <env>_artifactory_deployment_script property is optional. it will not impact the build. Its using for maintaining and providing correct value is appreciated.
